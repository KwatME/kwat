fever.</p>\n<p>If spleen and liver are not enlarged, then there is a less likelyhood of lymphoma or infection.\nEpigastric distention can lead to spleen distention.</p>\n<p>Lymphocytosis in the context of leukopenia is from the retension of lymphocytes rather than making of lymphocytes.</p>\n<p>Hematocrit rarely exceeds 60% because there is feedback regulation.</p>\n<p>10% of platelets are chilling in the spleen.\nPlatelet &#x3C;6-10K can lead to bleeding emergency.\nPlatelet &#x3C;3K is emergency.\nPlatelets secrete histamine, which causes itchyness and supresses various secretions like gastric acid.</p>\n<p>When ANC is low, pathogens (often from the self flora) infects the host.\nANC &#x3C;0.5 is emergency.\nANC 1 in the context of steroid or smoking may be the same as ANC 0.5, because this context makes neutrophils less stuck to vessels and results in more floting and thus measurable neutrophils.\nANC 1.5 is too fragile for chemotherapy.</p>\n<p>Alcohol and other conditions damage muscles, which then leak AST.</p>\n<p>Abdominal vessel distention suggests liver problem.</p>\n<p>Albumin &#x3C;3.2 suggests liver insufficiency.</p>\n<p>Both heriditary spherocytosis and autoimmune conditions result in spherocytes in the peripheral blood smear.</p>\n<p>Liver delivers the lipids needed for making membranes.\nLiver insufficiency thus results in hematopoiesis with defective membrane.\nThe resulting RBCs have weak membrane and deform into star shape, which can be seen in the peripheral blood smear.\nIn addition, liver insufficiency also leads to hypoalbuminea and low oncotic pressure.\nOncotic pressure pulls the water into the blood vessels, so with less of it, the blood vessels feel more dehydrated.\nAnd dehydration further stresses the RBC membranes and aggrevate the star shaped deformity.\nTreating the underlining liver problem eliminates this hematopoiesis abnormality.</p>\n<p>Iron releases EPO.\nPlatelet needs TPO.</p>\n<p>Diabetes and alcohol damages parotid glands and the patients often feel more thirsty.</p>\n<p>Female testosterone + 2 = male testosterone.\n2 can come from testosterone supplement.</p>\n<p>RBC can increase from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dehydration</li>\n<li>Capillary leak (Hanta virus can do this)</li>\n<li>High EPO</li>\n<li>High testosterone</li>\n<li>Low O2</li>\n<li>High Altitude</li>\n<li>High CO</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma can make EPO.</p>\n<p>JAK2 mutation leads to increased RBC production and causes a RBC cancer polycythemia vera.\nToo much RBC makes the blood sticky and clotty.</p>\n<p>CMV and EBV infects B cells.\nEBV is not sensitive to acyclovir.\nRituximab is anti B cell.</p>\n<p>Strep is anterior exudative while EBV is posterior exudative.</p>"},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/Plasma Cell Dyscrasias/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Plasma Cell Dyscrasias"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/Write
