life.</h2>\n<p>People with obsessive-compulsive and narcissistic personality disorders are associated with lower academic and financial attainment and higher disability.\nHalf of the male and one fifth of the female prisoners have antisocial personality disorder.\nBut with professional help, the people with personality disorders can have much better outcome in life.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosing personality disorder requires not having other psychiatric conditions.</h2>\n<p>Diagnosis requires ruling out myriad of conditions that can produce symptoms of personality disorders.</p>\n<p>Argument for diagnosing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Duty to warn</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Argument against diagnosing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Missing information</li>\n<li>Bad ethic</li>\n<li>Implying causality</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Personality disorder onset early in life.</h2>\n<p>Personality disorders are strongly heritable (40-60% inheritance in twin studies) and biologically based.\nChildhood adversities increase the likely hood of developing them.\nPeople with personality disorders have altered neurotransmitter, neuroendocrine, metabolic, and neural structures.</p>\n<h2>People with personality disorders have in common:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Difficulty with self-identify</li>\n<li>Difficulty relating to self and others</li>\n<li>Rigid thinking</li>\n<li>Maladaptation to environment</li>\n<li>Impaired social, occupational, or interpersonal functioning</li>\n<li>Defensiveness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Splitting is a defensive mechanism they use to divide good from evil.\nThey also associate with people who also have personality or other psychiatric disorders.</p>\n<p>They tend to not recognize their personality shortcomings.\nBut they attribute any dysfunction to causes other than their personalty.\nThis is why dysfunction is not required to diagnose a personality disorder.</p>\n<p>Obsessive compulsive personality disorder is not obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nThe former is egosyntonic.\nA person likes the obsession and compulsion, and has an excessive capacity to delay gratification.\nThe latter is egodystonic.\nA person has problems with the obsession and compulsion, which often is about symmetry, ordering, hoarding, and checking.</p>\n<h2>There are 3 clusters of personality disorders:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Cluster A: weired</li>\n<li>Cluster B: wild (antisocial personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder)</li>\n<li>Cluster C: worried</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Antisocial personality disorder is often misrepresented by as being \"not social\".</h2>\n<p>But in fact people with this are often charming.\nYet they lack empathy and disregard for rules and social norms.</p>\n<h2>Histrionic personality disorder is marked by need to be the center of attention, a theatrical outward emotional expression, and rapidly shifting emotions.</h2>\n<h2>Borderline personality disorder is marked with attention and treatment seeking characters.</h2>\n<p>It is also particularly associated with self-harm.</p>\n<h2>Pharmacotherapy remains controversial but is widespead in clinical practice.</h2>\n<p>Use psychotherapy to improve emotional regulation.</p>"},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/Eating Disorders/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Eating Disorders"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/Psychotic
