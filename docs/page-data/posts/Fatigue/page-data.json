usually won't make you tired.</h2>\n<p>It is also feeling of not having enough energy to do something that you can usually do.</p>\n<p>Some people also use fatigue to describe other symptoms like weakness, breathing difficulty, and more.</p>\n<p>So always someone what he or she mean by fatigue.</p>\n<h2>Many things can cause fatigue.</h2>\n<p>Acute fatigue can be caused by viral infection, heart failure exacerbation, and more.\nChronic diseases like cancer and multiple sclerosis can cause fatigue too.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, less than 10% of times, primary care physicians can identify the cause of a fatigue.\nAnd 75% of patients with fatigue have psychiatric symptoms.</p>\n<p>Here, we are going to focus on chronic fatigue in people who are otherwise healthy.</p>\n<h2>The differential diagnosis of such fatigue is:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Psychiatric (depression, anxiety, somatization dirorder, substance use)</li>\n<li>Sleep disorders (insomnia, obstrutive sleep apnea, periodic leg movements, narcolepsy)</li>\n<li>Endocrine (thyroid disease, diabetes, hypoadrenalism)</li>\n<li>Medications</li>\n<li>Hematologic or oncologic (anemia, cancer)</li>\n<li>Renal (failure)</li>\n<li>GI (liver disease)</li>\n<li>Cardiovascular (chronic)</li>\n<li>Pulmonary (chronic)</li>\n<li>Neuromuscular (myositis, mulriple sclerosis)</li>\n<li>Infectious (chronic)</li>\n<li>Rheumatologic (autoimmune)</li>\n<li>Idiopathic (chrofic fatigue syndrome)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Insomnia causes fatigue.</h2>\n<p>Primary insomnia can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Idiopathic</li>\n<li>Psychophysiologic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Secondary insomnia can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Psychosocial</li>\n<li>Poor sleep habit</li>\n<li>Due to medical condition</li>\n<li>Due to substance use</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Treat insomnia by improving sleep hygiene.\nGo to bed only when sleepy.\nUse bedroom only for sleep and sex.\nIf unable to fall asleep after 20 minutes, go to a differ room, relax, and only when sleepy return to bed.\nMaintain consistent sleep schedule.\nAvoid taking late naps.\nAvoid stimulants.\nExercise regularly but not in the late evening.</p>\n<p>Pharmacological treatments include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Benzodiazepines</li>\n<li>Benzodiazepine receptor agonists</li>\n<li>Anhihistamines</li>\n<li>Andidepressants</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They may produce quickler results but the results are less lasting compared to cognitive behavior therapy.</p>\n<h2>Obstructive sleep apnea canses fatigue.</h2>\n<p>An obstrutive apnea is 10 or more seconds of no breathing.\nDecreased pharyngeal muscle tone and narrowed airways make it more likely for negative pressure to collapse the airway.\nPeople with obstrutive sleep apnea describe their symptoms as fatigue.\nDiagnose obstrutive sleep apnea with polysomnography.</p>\n<h2>Periodic limb movement disorder can cause poor sleep and fatigue too.</h2>\n<p>This is rare is people younger then 30.</p>\n<h2>Hypothyroidism casues fatigue.</h2>\n<p>Women are 10 times more likely to have hypothyroidism.</p>\n<p>Primary hypothyroidism can be caused autoimmune thyroidditis (Hashimoto) in iodine sufficient areas.\nIn areas with not enough iodine in diets, iodine deficiency commonly causes hypothyroidism.\nIodine deficient hypothyroidism can manfest in large goiter because the thyroid gland is trying hard to do its job.\nAmiodarone and lithium commonly cause hypothyroidism too.</p>\n<p>Problems in hypothalamus or pituitary gland can cause central hypothyroidism.\nPituitary adenoma is a common cause.</p>\n<p>People with hypothyroidism present with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decreased metabolism</li>\n<li>Cold intolerance</li>\n<li>Weaker heart, resulting in low heart rate and hypotension</li>\n<li>Dry skin</li>\n<li>Fragile hair</li>\n<li>Fatigue</li>\n<li>Weaker lung, resulting in hypoventilation</li>\n<li>Decreased GI function, resulting in constipation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If TSH is normal, then no further testing is needed.\nIf it is high, then test for free T4.</p>\n<p>Because many fatigue patients have psychiatric symptoms, you must take detailed psychosocial and sleep history.\nAnemia, hypoadrenalism, or diabetes are usually not common in people with fatigue, but you must check for these because they are treatable.\nSo order blood count, chemistry panel including glucose, electrolyte, BUN, creatinine, and liver enzymes, and TSH.</p>"},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/Eating
