Hepatitis is usually not associated with fever.

If spleen and liver are not enlarged, then there is a less likelyhood of lymphoma or infection.
Epigastric distention can lead to spleen distention.

Lymphocytosis in the context of leukopenia is from the retension of lymphocytes rather than making of lymphocytes.

Hematocrit rarely exceeds 60% because there is feedback regulation.

10% of platelets are chilling in the spleen.
Platelet <6-10K can lead to bleeding emergency.
Platelet <3K is emergency.
Platelets secrete histamine, which causes itchyness and supresses various secretions like gastric acid.

When ANC is low, pathogens (often from the self flora) infects the host.
ANC <0.5 is emergency.
ANC 1 in the context of steroid or smoking may be the same as ANC 0.5, because this context makes neutrophils less stuck to vessels and results in more floting and thus measurable neutrophils.
ANC 1.5 is too fragile for chemotherapy.

Alcohol and other conditions damage muscles, which then leak AST.

Abdominal vessel distention suggests liver problem.

Albumin <3.2 suggests liver insufficiency.

Both heriditary spherocytosis and autoimmune conditions result in spherocytes in the peripheral blood smear.

Liver delivers the lipids needed for making membranes.
Liver insufficiency thus results in hematopoiesis with defective membrane.
The resulting RBCs have weak membrane and deform into star shape, which can be seen in the peripheral blood smear.
In addition, liver insufficiency also leads to hypoalbuminea and low oncotic pressure.
Oncotic pressure pulls the water into the blood vessels, so with less of it, the blood vessels feel more dehydrated.
And dehydration further stresses the RBC membranes and aggrevate the star shaped deformity.
Treating the underlining liver problem eliminates this hematopoiesis abnormality.

Iron releases EPO.
Platelet needs TPO.

Diabetes and alcohol damages parotid glands and the patients often feel more thirsty.

Female testosterone + 2 = male testosterone.
2 can come from testosterone supplement.

RBC can increase from:

- Dehydration
- Capillary leak (Hanta virus can do this)
- High EPO
- High testosterone
- Low O2
- High Altitude
- High CO

Renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma can make EPO.

JAK2 mutation leads to increased RBC production and causes a RBC cancer polycythemia vera.
Too much RBC makes the blood sticky and clotty.

CMV and EBV infects B cells.
EBV is not sensitive to acyclovir.
Rituximab is anti B cell.

Strep is anterior exudative while EBV is posterior exudative.

The prevelance of shingles in old people is 15-20%.
The prevelance of pneumonia in older people is 10%.

Inguinal and axilar lymphnodes are larger than the rest of palpable ones because these 2 are more active and more fibrosed.

Spleen is a platelet magnet.
Bigger the spleen, more platelets bind to it.

Suspect congenital causes in children.

Swelling of elbow in the context of low platelet can be from bleeding.
Swelling of body parts in children should remind of abuse and trauma too.
