## Primary headache can be caused by:

- Migraine
- Tension-type headache
- Cluster headache
- Trigeminal autonomic cephlgia

## Migraine

Activation of the trigeminothalamic pathway happens in a migraine.
Trigeminothalamic pathways is the face version of spinothalamic pathway.
Just as spinothalamic pathway senses the contralateral pain and temperature, trigeminothalamic pathway senses the contralateral face.
In addition, trigeminothalamic pathway is the sole pathway for sensing the cerebral blood vessels and dura.
Finally, the sensation from the back of the head travels via the upper cervical nerves and synapse on the CN 5 nuclei.

Activation of this pathway inflames the neural structures.
The activation leads to release of neuropeptides like substance P, calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), and neurokinin A.
These molecules sensitize the sensory structures.
In particular, CGRP mediates the trigeminovascular pain transmission.









More prevalent in female

Photosensitive

Prefer dark and quiet place

Young onset

Has trigger

Has family history

Sensitive scalp

For mignaine without signs of urgency, there is no need for ordering labs and images.

Migraine can present with aura or not.

### The classic migraine comes with aura.
Aura is a collection of sensations such as flashing lights or zigzag lines.
99% of aura comes with visual disturbance.

Disturbances can be other sensory and language sensations, but not motor weakness.

If there is at least 2 of the following symptoms, then the aura is a basilar aura, which indicates a problem in cranial nerve or posterior circulation:
- Dysarthria
- Vertigo
- Tinnitus
- Hyperacusis
- Diplopia
- Visual Symptoms simultaneously in temporal and nasal fields in both eyes
- Ataxia
- Decreased LOC
- Bilateral paresthesias

Classic aura develops gradually over minutes and is fully reversible within an hour.

### Migraine can come without aura too.

If a patient suffers at least five headache each lasting (without treatmnent) 4 to 72 hours and presenting with some of the following, then the patient has the migraine without aura:
- Unilateral
- Pulsating
- Moderate to severe pain
- Triggered by routine activity
- Photophobia
- Nausea or vomiting
- Not from other disease
