---

## Headache seems like a small problem, but it actually is a big one.

The most common neurologic disease is stroke.
The second most is Alzheimer's disease.
And the third most is headache.

## Brain actually cannot not feel pain.

So headache originates from the surrounding fossae and vascsular structures of the brain.

## 90% headache is [primary](../Primary Headache).

## The rest is [secondary](../Secondary Headache).
