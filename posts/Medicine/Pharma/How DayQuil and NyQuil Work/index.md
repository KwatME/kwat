title: How DayQuil and NyQuil Work
---

## The active gradients of DayQuil and NyQuil are:

- Dextromethorphan
- Acetaminophen

## Dextromethorphan suppresses cough.

It is a morphine class molecule.
But it won't bind to the mu-opioid receptor which is linked to addiction.

## Acetaminophen suppresses pain.

We don't know how it works.
