title: How DayQuil and NyQuil Work
---

## DayQuil and NyQuil have in common:

- Dextromethorphan
- Acetaminophen

## Dextromethorphan suppresses cough.

It is a morphine class molecule.
But it won't bind to the mu-opioid receptor which is linked to addiction.

## Acetaminophen suppresses pain and alleviates small pain.

We don't know how it works.

## NyQuil has doxylamine while DayQuil has phenylephrine.

## Doxylamine suppresses peripheral and central histamine.

Peripherally, it relieves congestion, sneezing, and sore threat.
Centrally, it decreases awakeness and increases eating (histamine increases awakeness and suppresses eating).

## Peripherally is a nasal decongestant.
