## There are multiple psychotic disorders.

They all have in common the symptoms of psychosis.
Psychosis is not a diagnosis.
It is a collection of symptoms.
Psychosis is narrowly defined as inability to distinguish between what is real and unreal.
It is broadly defined as deficit in perception, emotion, and or communication.

## Schizophrenia is a prominent psychotic disorder.

Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disease.
People belive this is true because:

- Pregnancy complications increase the chance of schizophrenia.
- Winter birth increases the chance of schizophrenia by 10%.
- Onset is teen to early 20s, a time period when developmental neural pruning takes place.

The brain of a schizophrenic person has more ventricular size, resulting in less space left for the brain.
The neurons are not damged (no gliosis), but disorganized.

Schizophrenia has has a strong inherited component.
Identical twin of a schizophrenic peson has 50 times more liklihood of developing it.

The prevelance of schizophrenia is the same in man and women.
It is associated with poverty and substance use.

## Having 2 or more of the symptoms, including one of the required ones and impaired daily function, for 6 or more months is the criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia.

- Hallucination (required)
- Delusion (false and fixed belief) (required)
- Thought disorder (affects speech) (required)
- Disorganized behavior (not functional)
- Any negative symptoms (lack of: affect, words, motivation, emotion, or socialization)

Having the symptoms for less than 1 month is brief psychotic disorder.
Less than 6 month is schizophreniform.
Treatment for all these psychotic disorders are the same.

Be mindful that a schizophrenic person is focussed on and scared of routine things.

## Psychosis can happen in other settings.

- Substance use
- Metabolic disorders
- Depression (more severe ones)
- Bipolar diorders

Schizoaffective disorder is when bipolar disorder aand schizophrenia happen at the same time.

Delusional disorder is when a person has only the delusional symptom.

Schizoid personality disorder is having a milder schizophrenia without full psychosis.
