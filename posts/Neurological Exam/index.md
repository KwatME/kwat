title: Neurological Exam

## Break down the exam into blocks:

- Mental status
- Cranial nerve
- Motor
- Reflex
- Sensory
- Cerebellar
- Gait

Some bad-ass neurologists perform the exam just by hearing patients talk and watching them walk.
(But I belive being systemic is better).

## Test Mental satus.

Test alertness by observing the patient.

Test attention by having the patient say the months of the year backwards.

Test orientation by having the patient say his or her full name, location, and site.

Test memory by giving the patient three items and have him or her recall them immediately (recent memory test) and few minutes later (delayed recall test). Also have the patient talk about personal verifiable history (remote memory test).

Test language by listening to the patient, paying attention to: paraphasic error, neologism, comprehension, naming, repeating, reading, and writing.

If you suspect any cognitive problem, then do Mini-Mental Status Exam. Score below 24 suggests dementia.

## Test cranial nerve.

CN1 and CN2 are not peripheral cranial nerves.
They are outgrowths of the brain.

If there is problem in CN3 to CN7, then the localization can be:

- Brainstem nuclei
- CN pathways
- Increased intracranial pressure

Test CN1 by having the patient, with eyes closed, smell something and identify it

Test CN2 acuity by having the patient, one eye at a time, read the letter in an acuity card.
It's okay to use eyeglasses.

Test CN2 visual field by having the patient, one eye at a time, look into your eyes and tell the number of fingers you show in the periphery of your visual field.
Use one, two, or five fingers.
Make sure the patient looks only at your eyes.

If there is visual field deficit, localize the lesion on the visual field pathways.

The light bouncing off of the things in the left visual field hits both eyes right retina.
Conversely, the light from the things in the right visual field hits the left retina of both eyes.
So, each eye has 2 (left and right) retinas, one medial and one lateral.
The lateral retina pathways send the signal to the same side of the occipital lobe.
But the medial retina pathways cross at the optic chiasm and send the signal to the opposite side of the occipital lobe.

Just as medial and lateral retina areas use different pathways to send signals to the occipital lobe, the superior and inferior retina areas also use different pathways.
The light from the lower visual field hits the superior retina area, which sends the signal through the parietal lobe.
The light from the upper visual field hits the inferior retina area, which sends the signal through posterior temporal lobe Meyer's loop.

Here are the pathways (without showing the superior retina pathway through the parieral lobe) and common lesions.

Here are some field loss examples.

Both right fields are bad.
![](image/visual_field_1.png)
The left eye problem can be in its: left retina, left retina pathway that says on the same side, and or left occipital lobe.
The right eye problem can be in its: left retina, left retina pathway that corssed the optic chiasm, and or left occipital lobe.
Since both must be true, the lesion is in the intersection of them, which is the left occipital lobe.

Both right upper fields are bad.
![](image/visual_field_2.png)
Same as the previous example, right fields deficit localize to left occipital lobe.
But here only the right upper fields are bad.
Since the light from the upper fields hit the lower retina, which send the signal through the Meyer's loop to the left occipital lobe, the lesion must be in the left Meyer's loop.

In general, more complete the sided field loss is, closer the lesion to the occipital cortex.

Left eye fields are bad.
![](image/visual_field_3.png)
The lesion must be messing up the pathways (lateral and medial) from the left retina.
So it must be in the left optic nerve.

Both lateral fields are bad.
![](image/visual_field_4.png)
Since light from the lateral fields hit the medial retinas (of both eyes), which send the signal that travel across the optic chiasm to the opposite occipital lobe, the lesion must be in the optic chiasm.

Look at CN2 optic disc with funduscope.
It should be close to the nose, have a sharp circular border, and contain consistent blood vessels.
Blurry border suggests papilledema.
Irregular blood vessels suggest hemorrhage.
![](image/fundus.png)

Test CN2 and CN3 pupillary response, which is a parasympathetic autonomic nervous system response.
CN2 carries signal into the brain.
CN3 sends constricting signal to both eyes.

Just like other cranial nerves (excpet CN1), there are two CN3 nuclei called Edinger-Westphal nuclei, one on each side of the brainstem.
One eye's CN2 sends signal to both sides of the brain through one pathway that stays on the same side and aother pathway that crosses to the other side via optic chiasm.
So, either eye can activate both of the CN3 nuclei.
A CN3 nucleus outputs two CN3s, one constricting each pupil.
So, any light in either eye can constrict both pupils.

By default, as you are reading this, some light is coming into your eyes resulting in some constriction.

If pupillary response is deficit in both eyes, then the brainstem (where both CN3 nuclei live) may have a lesion.
If deficit in one eye, then the CN3 of that side has the lesion.

For each eye, shine light on it once to verify this eye's pupillary constricton and another time to verify the other eye's constriction.
This is a binary test of dilation and constriction.
![](image/light.png)

To test (beyond binary) the magnitude of the pupillary response, flash light between pupils every two seconds.
If a pupil dilates when the light switches to it, then this eye has problem in the eye itself or the optic nerve.
This is called afferent pupillary defect.
It happens when the normal eye successfully activates the CN3, resulting in bilateral pupillary constriction, but the defective eye fails to send enough signal needed for constriction of equal magnitude.
![](image/apd.png)

Pupil constricts also when there is pupillary accomodation.
Test this by place a finger infront of a patient's eye and have the patient look at it for a while.
Pupil should constrict during this focus.
Then, have the patient look at something far behind you.
This unfocuss should dilate the pupils.

CN3 parasympathetic branch constricts pupils but CN3 sympathetic brnach can dilate them.
CN3 sympathetic branch descends the spinal cord down to the thoracic vertebra 1 and 2, exit to sympathetic chain, and ascends back up to the neck along the internal carotid artery.
And this fight-or-flight branch dilates pupil, elevate eyelid, controls sweat glands of the neck and face.
![](image/cn3s.png)

Patients with Horner's syndrome has defects in CN3 sympathetic branch.
So they suffer from a collection of neurological defects inlcuding ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis.

Test CN3, CN4, and CN6 by testing extraocular muscles.
Defect in eye movement results in diplopia.

CN3 innervates all the muscles except superior oblique, which is innervated by CN4, and lateral rectus, which is innervated by CN6.
Superior oblique intorts the eyes.
It is used for looking at the mouth.
Lateral rectus abducts the eyes.
It is used to look at outer horizontal sides.
This makes sense evolutionarily.
We come from fish.
Fish have eyes on both sides of their body, so they cannot look at their mouth and do not need to look at outer horizontal sides.
As we evolved to become a land animal, we probably needed to look at our mouth to see what we were about to eat.
And this may be the advent of lateral rectus and abducens nerve (CN6).
Then as we evolved more and our eyes moved to the front of the face, narrowing the horizontal visual field, we needed to look laterally to stop any potential threats.
And this may be the advent of superior oblique and trochlear nerve (CN4).

Between 4 and 6 is 5, which detects sensation on the face.
This makes sense evolutionarily too because we acquired face (or head) some time between fish and front-eyed animal.

Anyways, have the patient look at your finger and chase it as you move it drawing a huge H symbol.
Patient looks side, side-up, side-down, and repeat for the other side.

Although CN6 innervates directly only the lateral rectus, it also synapses with CN3 nucleus and controls medial rectus.
Just as Edinger-Westphal nucleus of one side sends CN3s (bifurcating near the nucleus) to both eyes, nucleus of CN6 sends CN6s to both eyes.
But for the pathway that goes to the contralateral eye, CN6 travels on the medial longitudinal fasciculus and synapses with CN3 nucleus, which directly innervates the medial rectus.
Overall, CN6 controls the ipsilateral eye directly and contralateral eye via CN3, ending up controling the eye movements to the sides.

So, if a patient cannot moving both eyes to the right, then the right CN6 nucleus is defective.
Conversely, if a patient cannot move move both eyes to the left, then the left CN6 nucleus is defective.

If on the other hand, only the left eye fails to move to the right (medially), then the medial CN6-CN3 relay pathways is defective.
And the lesion may be on the medial longitudinal fasciculus.
![](image/diplopia.png)

In summary, a patient with CN3 defect may present with ptosis and eye movement limited to intort.

A patient with CN4 defect presents with inability to intort.

A patient with CN6 defect presents with inability abduct.

## Test motor functions.

## Test reflexs.

## Test sensory functions.

## Test cerebellar functions.

## Test gait.

## Look out for higher order cognitive functions.

Test apraxia by having the patient show you how he or she brushes teeth.
Test for adnosia by having the patient, with the eyes closed, point to the side you touch. First, touch one side at a time to verify that the primary sensation is intact. And then touch both sides at the same time. If there is adnosia, the patient will neglect the affected side.
