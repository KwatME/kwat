title: Fatigue
---

## Fatigue is a feeling of being tired after an activity that usually won't make you tired.

It is also feeling of not having enough energy to do something that you can usually do.

Some people also use fatigue to describe other symptoms like weakness, breathing difficulty, and more.

So always someone what he or she mean by fatigue.

## Many things can cause fatigue.

Acute fatigue can be caused by viral infection, heart failure exacerbation, and more.
Chronic diseases like cancer and multiple sclerosis can cause fatigue too.

Surprisingly, less than 10% of times, primary care physicians can identify the cause of a fatigue.
And 75% of patients with fatigue have psychiatric symptoms.

Here, we are going to focus on chronic fatigue in people who are otherwise healthy.

## The differential diagnosis of such fatigue is:

- Psychiatric (depression, anxiety, somatization dirorder, substance use)
- Sleep disorders (insomnia, obstrutive sleep apnea, periodic leg movements, narcolepsy)
- Endocrine (thyroid disease, diabetes, hypoadrenalism)
- Medications
- Hematologic or oncologic (anemia, cancer)
- Renal (failure)
- GI (liver disease)
- Cardiovascular (chronic)
- Pulmonary (chronic)
- Neuromuscular (myositis, mulriple sclerosis)
- Infectious (chronic)
- Rheumatologic (autoimmune)
- Idiopathic (chrofic fatigue syndrome)

## Insomnia causes fatigue.

Primary insomnia can be:

- Idiopathic
- Psychophysiologic

Secondary insomnia can be:

- Psychosocial
- Poor sleep habit
- Due to medical condition
- Due to substance use

Treat insomnia by improving sleep hygiene.
Go to bed only when sleepy.
Use bedroom only for sleep and sex.
If unable to fall asleep after 20 minutes, go to a differ room, relax, and only when sleepy return to bed.
Maintain consistent sleep schedule.
Avoid taking late naps.
Avoid stimulants.
Exercise regularly but not in the late evening.

Pharmacological treatments include:

- Benzodiazepines
- Benzodiazepine receptor agonists
- Anhihistamines
- Andidepressants

They may produce quickler results but the results are less lasting compared to cognitive behavior therapy.

## Obstructive sleep apnea canses fatigue.

An obstrutive apnea is 10 or more seconds of no breathing.
Decreased pharyngeal muscle tone and narrowed airways make it more likely for negative pressure to collapse the airway.
People with obstrutive sleep apnea describe their symptoms as fatigue.
Diagnose obstrutive sleep apnea with polysomnography.

## Periodic limb movement disorder can cause poor sleep and fatigue too.

This is rare is people younger then 30.

## Hypothyroidism casues fatigue.

Women are 10 times more likely to have hypothyroidism.

Primary hypothyroidism can be caused autoimmune thyroidditis (Hashimoto) in iodine sufficient areas.
In areas with not enough iodine in diets, iodine deficiency commonly causes hypothyroidism.
Iodine deficient hypothyroidism can manfest in large goiter because the thyroid gland is trying hard to do its job.
Amiodarone and lithium commonly cause hypothyroidism too.

Problems in hypothalamus or pituitary gland can cause central hypothyroidism.
Pituitary adenoma is a common cause.

People with hypothyroidism present with:

- Decreased metabolism
- Cold intolerance
- Weaker heart, resulting in low heart rate and hypotension
- Dry skin
- Fragile hair
- Fatigue
- Weaker lung, resulting in hypoventilation
- Decreased GI function, resulting in constipation

If TSH is normal, then no further testing is needed.
If it is high, then test for free T4.

Because many fatigue patients have psychiatric symptoms, you must take detailed psychosocial and sleep history.
Anemia, hypoadrenalism, or diabetes are usually not common in people with fatigue, but you must check for these because they are treatable.
So order blood count, chemistry panel including glucose, electrolyte, BUN, creatinine, and liver enzymes, and TSH.
