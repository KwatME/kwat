title: Delirium and Dememtia
---

## Change in mental status can be a delirium or dementia.

Patients can present with altered level of consciousness, decreased attention, and disorganized thinking.

## Delirium is acute, reversible, and has an underlying non-neurologic cause.

Decrese in the perfusion to the brain causes delirium.
The specific conditions that impair the perfusion are:

- Dehydration
- Hypoglycemia and yperglycemia
- Electrolyte abnormalities
- Acidosis and alkalosis
- Hypoxia and hypercapnia
- Azotemia
- Thiamine deficiency
- Thyroid disease
- Liver disease
- CNS infection
- Systemic infection
- HIV
- Ischemic stroke
- Hemorrhagic stroke
- Vasculitis
- CNS tumor
- Subdural hematoma
- Myocardial infarction
- Heart failure
- Arrythmia
- Meidcation and substances
- Alcohol withdraw

Symptoms vary during the day.

Having other neurologic conditions increase the chance of getting a delirium.
Delirium can unmask underlining dementia.
Older hospitalized patients often get delirium.
Having a severe disease also makes delirium likely.

Alcohol withdraw presents with irritability, hypertension, tachycardia, hallucination, and delirium.

## Dementia is chronic and not reversible.

A patient with dementia has no problem in consciousness.
But the patient has imparing aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or impaired executive function.
Dementia has more CNS specific associations:

- Alzheimer's
- Levy bodies
- Vascular
- Frontotemporal
- Alcohol

## 70% of dementia is due to Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease is more common in older people.
In its early phase, it presents with language problems.
Later presents with memory loss, personality change, social withdrawal, and functional imparement.

Before diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, rule out other causes.

## Memory imparement test has 97% specificity in detecting dementia.

In this test, give a patient 4 words.
The patient matches the words to a category.
2-3 minutes later, the patient recalls the words.
Recalling an item receives 2 points.
Recalling with the hint of the category receives 1 point.
Total score of less than 5 out of 8 is positive for dementia.

## The second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease is vascular dementia.

It can onset abruptly.
The patient presents with focal neurologic deficit or central neurologic deficits.

## People with mild cognitive impairment do not have any functional imparement but poor memory.

They have higher rate of progression to dementia.
