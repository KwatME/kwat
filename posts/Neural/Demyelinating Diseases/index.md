## Large axons are myelinated.

Oligodendrocytes in the CNS and Schwan cells in the PNS extend their membrane to wrap axons.
These membranes are the myelin membranes.
Myelin membranes not only insulate axons and speed up the axonal conduction, but also helps with adhesion, enzymatic activity, and more.
1 oligodendrocyte wraps many axons.

## During embryonic development, peripheral nervous system is myelinated first.

This is why babies are keen to pain and motion before they exhibit higher functions.
Myelination completes by 2 year old.

## Primary demyelination starts from the myelin membrane.

Macrophages breakdown the myelin membranes.
In an acute phase, oligodendrocytes try to remyelinate.
Without myelin, the axons cannot conduct fast.
For a while, the axons can survive.
But without remyelination, the axons die.

Multiple diseaes can cause primary demyelination.

- Multiple sclerosis (autoimmune)
- Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (viral)
- Leukodystrophies (congenital)
- Central pontine myelinolysis (acquired metabolic)
- Inflammatory polyneuropathies (Guillain-Barre syndrome, ...)

## Secondary demyelination is starts from the axon.

Axon and myelin need each other.
Axon damage leads to myelin damage.
So, neural injuries end up injurying myelin membranes.

## Multiple sclerosis is the most common neurologic disorders of young adults.

Multiple sclerosis has strong inherited component.
Risk in general population is 1/1000.
Risk when a parent has it is 1/50.
Risk when a sigbling or fraternal twin has it is 1/20.
Risk when an identical twin ahs it is 1/3.
HLA haplotypes are linked to the inheritance.
History of EBV infection doubles the risk.

Onset is 20-50.
Prevelance is higher in caucasians and female.
More ultraviolet and vitamin D exposures in early life reduce risk.

## Autoimmunity against myelin membranes cause multiple sclerosis.

In an acute (more inflammatory) lesion, there are anti-myelin antibodies and a lot of cells.
Macrophages and lymphocytes breakdown the myelin membranes.
Activated astrocytes and microglia participate too.
Oligodendrocytes remyelinate axons.
Axons are somewhat preserved.

In a chronic (less inflammatory) lesion, there is less cells and more scars.
Gliosis takes up the realestate, preventing remyelination or other regenerative processes.
Both oligodendrocytes and axons are lost.

The autoimmune attack is global and does not respect anatomic boundaries.
It demyelinates and damages multiple white matters in the CNS.
Demyelination is diffuse and can show up in a neuroimaging as sparse shadows in the white matters.

The attack is ongoing.
A patient presents with multiple discreet episodes of neurologic dysfunction.

Plasma cells produce oligoclonal band.
Oligoclonal bands present in CSF but absent in the blood suggests multiple sclerosis.

## 85% of multiple sclerosis is relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis.

A new demyelination comes with a new neurologic symptom, which can last from hours to days.

Diagnosis of this type requires demyelination dissemination in space and time.
Dissemination in space means demyelination in 2 of the following regions:

- Periventricular (common - perhaps due to higher exposure to the CSF, which may contain immunogenic things)
- Juxtacortical
- Infratentorial
- Spinal cord

Dissemination in time means neurologic symptoms that are relapsing and remitting.

## Secondary progresive multiple sclerosis is when relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis progresses to neurodegenerative state.

Overtime, relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis becomes a constant neurodegenerative condition.

## 15% of multiple sclerosis is primary progressive multiple sclerosis.

It is more common in male, unlike the relapsing and remitting type.
Its onset is 40-60, older than the relapsing and remitting type.
Its onset is gradual, and this makes it harder to diagnose.

## Treat multiple sclerosis with immunomodulation.

For the primary progressive type, ocrelizumab is approved.
New treatments try to remyelinate the axons by for example stimulating oligodendrocytes.

## Other conditions can demyelinate too.

Neuromyelitis Optica (antibody to aquaporin 4 in astrocytes causing severe and long demyelination and optic neuritis)

Anti-MOG (optic nerve lesion with equal male to female prevalence)

Tumefactive multiple sclerosis (large acute lesion)

## Infection can lead to acute disseminated encephalomyelitides.

Brain infection is more common in children so is this demyelinating condition.
In acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, symptoms last for few weeks and recover completely.
In acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis, symptoms are hyperacute and a patient often dies in few days from brain swelling (which can result in vascular damage, white matter petechiae, necrosis, and inflammation).

## Pregnancy is protective againt multiple sclerosis.

Consider stopping treatment during pregnancy.
Breast feeding also reduces multiple sclerosis.
