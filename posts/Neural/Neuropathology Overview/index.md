## Brain is more specialized than other organs.

Its regions have specialized functions and symptoms.

## Mass effect is more serious in the brain because it is confined.

Mass effect compromises first CSF, then blood, and then the parenchyma.

## Immunostain and see.

Use anti-:

- Cytokeratin for epithelial intermediate filament
- GFAP for glial intermediate filament
- Myelin basic protein for myelin
- Neurofilament for neuron
- Snaptophysin for synaptic vescicle

## Grey matter has more neuron bodies.

(White matter has more neuron axons.)

Neurons are bigger than glia.
Neuron bodies are filled with rough endoplasmic reticulum.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.13.30 PM.png)

Neurons have many shapes.

Silver impregnation is a staining technique that fills neurons with silver.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.13.47 PM.png)

Anti-neurofilament stain can also outline the neurons.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.13.53 PM.png)

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.14.17 PM.png)

Anti-synaptophysin stain highlights synaptic vescicles.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.14.00 PM.png)

Electronmicroscopy captures synaptic vescicles too.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.14.08 PM.png)

Neurons are sensitive to hypoxia.
Not immediately after an ischemic injury but 6 hours after, neuron bodies become eosinophilic and die.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.14.37 PM.png)

Neurons are quiescent by default.
But in response to a damage, neurons start to make more proteins.
In this production mode, the tightly packed rough endoplasmic reticula move aside and make more space for cytoplasm.
More space is good for more proteins.
This cytosol reorganization is called chromatolysis.

Dead neurons in fetus take in or is filled with various minerals.
These nuerons look like they are impregnated with the classic Silver stain.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.15.03 PM.png)

Dead neurons are eaten by macrophages of the brain, microglia.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.15.12 PM.png)

Neurons can accumulate things.

Throughout the normal aging, lipofuscin accumulate in many cell types including neuron.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.15.19 PM.png)

Neuro melanin, which is not even close to skin melanin, accumulate in special neuron in the substantia nigra.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.15.27 PM.png)

Lipids also accumulate in neurons.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.15.35 PM.png)

But too much lipid in neuron results in meganeurite and is bad.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.15.47 PM.png)

In neurodegenerative diseases, neural intracellular things break and tangle.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.15.55 PM.png)

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.16.00 PM.png)

Viruses can get into neurons and make viral compartments.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.16.06 PM.png)

## Axons are long.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.16.32 PM.png)

When they are damaged, their neuron continue to send things toward the axon.
These things can accumulate at the damaged site and result in spheroid there.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.16.15 PM.png)

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.16.21 PM.png)

Neurons respond to axon damage by making more things.
To make more things their rough endoplasmic reticula move aside and make more space for cytoplasm.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.16.55 PM.png)

Myelin covers axons.
Myelin can degenerate.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.17.00 PM.png)

Myelinated axons make up the white tract.
So a lot of damage in myelin can result in big white matter tract degeneration.

## Glia is the most abundant cell type in the brain, making up 20-50% of the volume.

## Astrocytes can be protoplasmic (grey) or fibrillar (white) and do various things.

- Fill extra-neural space
- Guide neural migration
- Angiogenesis
- Nurish
- Clear neurotrasmitter
- Make up the blood brain barrier

Astrocytes look like star.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.18.54 PM.png)

Astrocytes cover the endothelia and patch together the blood brain barrier.
Only the actively transported things and lipids can cross the blood brain barrier.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.20.03 PM.png)

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.19.00 PM.png)

Like neurons, astrocytes can change form and respond to stress.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.18.47 PM.png)

One of the response forms is genistocytic astrocytes.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.20.09 PM.png)

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.20.16 PM.png)

Not related to Alzheimer's disease, there is a astrocyte form called Alzheimer type 2 astrocyte.
This form has orphan nucleus.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.20.22 PM.png)

Astrocytes can take up glycoproteins too.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.20.32 PM.png)

Astrocytes guide neural migration and shape the tissue.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.18.38 PM.png)

Neoplasm of astrocyte is astrocytoma.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.20.44 PM.png)

## Oligodendrocytes wrap axons with myelin sheath.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.20.55 PM.png)

Loss of oligodendrocyte and autoimmunity against myelin lead to loss of myelin and white matter.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.21.06 PM.png)

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.21.15 PM.png)

Neoplasm of oligodendrocyte is oligodendrocytoma.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.21.21 PM.png)

## Ependymal cells are ciliated and make the choroid plexus.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.21.34 PM.png)

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.21.45 PM.png)

They make CSF.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.21.53 PM.png)

Neoplasm of ependyma is ependymoma.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.22.09 PM.png)

## Microglia are CNS macrophages.

Lile neurons and astrocytes, they are quiet by default and respond to stress.

Quiet ones are hard to see.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.22.20 PM.png)

Active ones look cool.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.22.26 PM.png)

Microglia can team up and eat a neuron, which is much biger than a glia.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.22.35 PM.png)

Many microglia must come together to clear neurons infected with viruses.
Like macrophages forming giant cells, microglia form nodules.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.22.36 PM.png)

Brian is a lipid rich environemnt.
Microglia also take up the lipids.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.22.42 PM.png)

## Selective damage

Different parts of the brain are susceptible to different types of stress.

Hypoxia damages temporal lobe hippocampus.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.23.18 PM.png)

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.23.28 PM.png)

Alcohol damages caudate, putamen, and cerebellum.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.24.15 PM.png)

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.24.27 PM.png)

Radiation damages white matter.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.24.48 PM.png)

Substantia nigra has selective vulnerability too.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.24.38 PM.png)

## Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy

JC virus infects oligodendrocytes and disrupt myelination.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.25.26 PM.png)

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.25.16 PM.png)

As a result, a brain infected with JC virus has multi focal white matter damage.

![](image/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 1.25.05 PM.png)
