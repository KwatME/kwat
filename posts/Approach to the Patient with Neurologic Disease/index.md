## How to be a good neurologist?

1. Know a lot to make a comprehensive differential diagnosis
2. Take detailed history
3. Identify timing and localization
4. Be systematic

## Three steps in neurological diagnosis

1. Identify timing
2. Idenitfy localization
3. List a differential diagnosis

Only after doing these three, order any diagnosic test.

## Timing

### Acute (~day)

- Stroke
- Hemorrhage
- Trauma

### Aute followed by spotaneous recovery, or episodic

- Transient ischemic attack
- Seizure
- Migraine

### Subacute (~weeks)

- Infection
- Subdural hematoma
- Fast growing tumor

### Subacute and fluctuating

Inflammatory or demyelinating

- Multiple sclerosis

### Chronic (~months)

Degenerative

- Alzheimer's
- Parkinson's
- Slow growing tumor

## Localization

Localize the lesion on the y-axis (central to peripheral) of the nervous system first and then on the x-axis.

X-axis

If the localization does not explain the symptoms and signs, then consider multifocal etiology.

Associated symptoms help localize the lesion.

### CNS

- Cognitive problem
- Cortical signs
- Hemiparesis
- Paralysis
- Babinski sign
- Clonus
- Spasticity
- Hyperreflexia

### Upper motor neuron

Lesion in the descending corticospinal tracts

- Pyramidal pattern (voluntary motor problem in the precise path from the coretex to muscle)
- Spasticity
- Hyperreflexia

### Basal ganglia

- Extrapyramidal pattern (involuntary motor problem in the hypothesized CNS pathways)
- Only motor symptoms and contralateral symptoms
- Hypo- or hyperkinetic
- Rigidity
- Bradykinesia

### Cerebellum

- Ataxia
- Wide-based gait
- Inability to tandem walk
- Intention tremor

### Lower motor neuron or peripheral nervous system

- No cognitive symptoms
- Floppy tone
- Hypo- or areflexia
- Atrophy
- Sensory and or motor deficit following a nerve distribution
- Fasciculation

For example, a patient with right foot drop can have a lesion in: foot muscle, neuromuscular junction, peroneal nerve, sciatic nerve, lumbosacral plexus, L4-S1 roots, spinal cord, subcortical fibers, and or motor cortex leg area.

## Five co-affected anatomical groups

![](coaffected_anatomical_groups.png)

### CNS groups

- Head and ipsilateral body (lesion in contralateral cerebral cortex - problem above crossing)

- Head and contralateral body (lesion in the brain stem on the side of the affected head - problem right before crossing, where cranial nerves come out without crossing)

- Body below a spinal root (lesion at the root)

### PNS groups

- Distal to proximal (lesion from the periphery, like peripheral neuropathy)

- Proximal to distal (lesion in muscles)

## Examples

Weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, clonus, and Babinski sign <- Upper motor neuron (corticospinal tract)

Weakness, atrophy, fasciculations, hyporeflexia, absent reflexes <- Lower motor neuron

Loss of sensation, symmetric distal stocking glove paresthesias, bilateral foot weakness, decreased or absent reflexes <- Peripheral neuropathy (sensorimotor)

All symptoms below the neck, loss of positional and vibrational sense on right, decrease of pain and temperature sense on left, weakness on right <- Spinal cord (right hemicord)

Weakness and decreased sensation on right face and left body <- Brainstem (right pons, where CN5 is)

Left cranial nerve 3 palsy and right hemiparesis <- Brainstem (midbrain, where CN3 is)

Wide based gait, unable to tandem, dyscoordination in limbs <- Cerebellum

Numbness in little finger and half of ring finder <- Peripheral neuropathy (ulnar nerve)

Pure motor weakness, atrophy and fasciculations of the hand muscle with increased reflexes, spasticity, no sensory involvement <- Upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron (anterior horm cells)

Symmetric proximal weakness, preserved reflexes, no sensory deficit <- Muscle

Aphasia, cortical sign, right hemiparesis <- Left cerebral cortex

Pure motor symptoms, fatigueble weakness with preserved reflexs <- Neuromuscular junction

Bradykinesia, rigidity, rest tremor <- Basal ganglia (extrapyramidal)

Left face, arm, body, leg hemiparesis <- Right cerebral cortex

## A's and D's

Aphasia, anopsia, agnosia, apraxia, amnesia, altered mental status <- Cortical signs <- Cerebral cortex

Diplopsia, dysphagia, dysequilibrium, dyscoordination, dysconjugate gaze <- Psterior fossa signs <- Brainstem
